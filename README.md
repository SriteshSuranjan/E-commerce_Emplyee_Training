# E-commerce Client Training Project Using Linear Regression

## Overview

This project uses linear regression to analyze customer data from an e-commerce website. The goal is to determine whether the company should focus more on their mobile app experience or their desktop website based on the data. The dataset used is available on Kaggle and includes information about customer sessions and spending.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:
- **Avg. Session Length:** Average length of in-store style advice sessions.
- **Time on App:** Average time spent on the app in minutes.
- **Time on Website:** Average time spent on the website in minutes.
- **Length of Membership:** Number of years the customer has been a member.
- **Yearly Amount Spent:** Amount spent by the customer per year.

## Objectives

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze the relationship between time spent on each platform and the amount spent per year.
2. **Model Building:** Create a linear regression model to predict yearly expenditure based on the provided features.
3. **Evaluation:** Assess the performance of the model and provide recommendations.

## Steps

### 1. Importing Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

### 2. Getting the Data

Load the dataset and perform basic data exploration:
```python
df = pd.read_csv('ecommerce.csv')
df.head()
df.info()
df.describe()
```

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize relationships between features and yearly expenditure:
```python
sns.jointplot(x="Time on Website", y="Yearly Amount Spent", data=df, alpha=0.5)
sns.jointplot(x="Time on App", y="Yearly Amount Spent", data=df, alpha=0.5)
sns.pairplot(df, kind='scatter', plot_kws={'alpha':0.4})
sns.lmplot(x='Length of Membership', y='Yearly Amount Spent', data=df, scatter_kws={'alpha':0.3})
```

### 4. Splitting the Data

Prepare training and test datasets:
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X = df[['Avg. Session Length', 'Time on App', 'Time on Website', 'Length of Membership']]
y = df['Yearly Amount Spent']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
```

### 5. Training the Model

Create and train the linear regression model:
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
lm = LinearRegression()
lm.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### 6. Evaluating the Model

Assess the model's performance and visualize predictions:
```python
predictions = lm.predict(X_test)
sns.scatterplot(x=predictions, y=y_test)
plt.xlabel('Predictions')
plt.title('Evaluation of our LM Model')
plt.show()
```

Calculate model performance metrics:
```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error
import math
print('Mean Absolute Error (MAE): ', mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions))
print('Mean Squared Error (MSE): ', mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions))
print('Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): ', math.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)))
```

Analyze residuals:
```python
residuals = y_test - predictions
sns.displot(residuals, bins=30, kde=True)
plt.show()
import pylab
import scipy.stats as stats
stats.probplot(residuals, dist='norm', plot=pylab)
pylab.show()
```

### 7. Conclusion

The analysis suggests that:
- **Length of Membership** is the most significant predictor of yearly expenditure.
- **Time on App** has a notable impact compared to **Time on Website**, which shows negligible correlation with spending.

### Recommendations

1. **Focus on Improving the App:** Since the app has a stronger influence on spending, consider enhancing its features and user experience.
2. **Reevaluate Desktop Website:** The desktop site may require improvements to better engage customers and increase spending.
